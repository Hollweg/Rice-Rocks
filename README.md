#Rice Rocks

##The purpose:

This software was developed for course **Introduction to Iteractive Programming in Python - part 2**, from **Rice University** by the online courses platform Coursera. The code was developed in December 2013. </br>
The game template was grant by **Rice University** teachers.

If you have some interest to see the Python courses from Rice University, take a look on the links below:

##How the game works?

The code was developed to run on the platform grant for Rice University, the **CodeSkulptor**, but it can be adapted to work on different Python environments, since that **code portability would be made**. We used in this code some specific libraries, very similiar to libraries on Python game frameworks, like **Pygame**, for example.

To visualize the game working fine on its original platform, click on the link below and in **play (in the superior right corner of screen)**. It should open a browser pop-up and the game must work! :D

##Game Instructions

The game objective is to get the **highest score and try to survive the meteors.**

- You start with 3 lives </br>
- Destroy one asteroid give you 1 point. </br>
- Every 250 score you'll receive an extra life. </br>
- There is a button to Reset the game. </br>
- There is a field to put your name and a field to change (if desired) the ship thrust velocity (0.1 to 1). </br>
- There are 4 different difficulties. </br>

Note: You only can **change the game difficulty** if the game is **reseted**.
